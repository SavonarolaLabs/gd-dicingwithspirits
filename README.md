## Overview

Dicing with Spirits is a two-player dice card-based team battler. This is a beta version, so some rules and elements may be subject to change.

## Requirements

-   Each player has:
    -   5 six-sided dice
    -   5 spirit profile cards
    -   5 spirit positioning cards
    -   3 lesser support spirit cards

## Game Setup

### Starting Turn

-   Players roll their 5 dice to decide who starts as offensive and who starts as defensive.
-   Players lay out their spirit positioning cards in a line opposite their opponentâ€™s cards.
-   A starting roll occurs at the start of each turn.

### Dice and Positioning

-   Players place dice on spirit positioning cards to trigger actions. Dice values determine outcomes.
-   A spirit can only have one die per turn. Dice with a value of 1 do nothing.
-   Actions are triggered in the order decided by dice placement direction (left or right).

## Game Flow

### Core Turn

1. Players select one die at a time and place it on their spirit positioning cards.
2. When a die is placed, the corresponding action is activated.
3. Once all spirits have acted, the turn ends.

### Subsequent Turns

-   The offensive and defensive roles switch.
-   Dice are removed from spirit cards and returned to the pool.
-   If a spirit is slain, a player can activate one of their lesser support spirits for the rest of the game.
-   Players may swap up to 2 spirit positioning cards unless a spirit was slain in the previous turn (then the player must retreat).

## Retreating

-   Players can move their spirit positioning cards to any order and heal all spirits with zero health.
-   A player loses the game if they have to retreat a fourth time.

## Actions

-   **Non-Damaging Actions**: These actions occur based on whether the player is offensive or defensive.
-   **Damaging Actions**: Melee and ranged attacks are marked with icons:
    -   **Sword**: Melee attack (damage value specified).
    -   **Bow and Arrow**: Ranged attack (damage and range specified).

### Action Order

-   Non-damaging actions of the offensive player occur first, followed by the defensive.
-   Damaging actions occur simultaneously unless one action is faster (denoted by icons).

## Special Keywords

-   **Germination**: Requires an unused die with a value of 6 to trigger an additional effect.
-   **Burning**: Reroll the highest friendly die to activate an additional effect.
-   **Harvest**: The activating spirit takes self-damage for an additional effect.
-   **Frosted**: Requires a die with value 1 used during the same turn for an additional effect.

## Winning the Game

-   The player who forces their opponent to retreat a fourth time wins.
-   If both players have retreated 3 times and must retreat simultaneously, play continues in overtime until one player retreats alone.

## Team Building

-   A standard team consists of spirits sharing the same icon (seasonal theme).
-   It is recommended not to use duplicate spirits.

## Notes

-   This is a beta version; rules and mechanics may change based on feedback and playtesting.
